                    Its a short, three minute walk to a large, flat, private, soft, white sand beach; ideal for swimming, sunning, snorkeling, or fishing, for bonefish on the beach or grouper and snapper off the rock jetty. For more adventure, try diving for lobster right off the very quiet, secluded beach. Rental fishing boats, with guide, fishing rods and bait, are available. Snorkel equipment and ocean kayaks are also available for rent.

                    Scuba diving and snorkeling are some of the most popular activities, and the Bahamas boasts some of the best dive sites around. At the UNEXSO Dolphin Encounter, a swim with the friendly dolphins is a breathtaking experience to cherish! If you enjoy deep-water fishing, there are many rental boats, to go catch that elusive Grouper, Wahoo, Barracuda or other reef fish.
